The Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off refers to the dilemma of choosing between exploring new possibilities to learn more about the environment and exploiting the current knowledge to maximize rewards. The video introduces the Epsilon-Greedy Policy, a simple yet effective solution to this problem. The policy suggests that with probability ε (epsilon), the agent chooses a random action (exploration) and with probability (1 - ε), it chooses the action with the highest Q-value (exploitation). This balance allows the agent to explore and learn while maximizing rewards.",
